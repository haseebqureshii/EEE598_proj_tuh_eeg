        "- For each EDF:\n",
        "  - Load EEG + its seizure annotations (.csv).\n",
        "  - Bandpass 0.5â€“40 Hz using a Kaiser FIR, zero-phase (`filtfilt`).\n",
        "  - Downsample to 250 Hz *if* original fs is higher; never upsample.\n",
        "  - Robust z-score per channel (median/IQR).\n",
        "  - Slice into 10 s windows with 5 s hop.\n",
        "  - Label each window seizure(1) or background(0), pooling all seizure subtypes.\n",

        "   - For each reference channel name (like `FP1-F7`), we try to find the best-matching channel name in the new recording using a robust normalizer.\n",
        "   - If found, we copy that channel.\n",
        "   - If missing, we fill zeros in that row.\n",
        "3. We compute a **coverage ratio** = fraction of reference channels we could actually fill with real data from this recording.\n",
        "   - If coverage is too low (default <30%), we SKIP that recording to avoid mostly-zero data.\n",
