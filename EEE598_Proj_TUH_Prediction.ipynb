        "## High-level\n",
        "This notebook builds a seizure vs background window dataset from TUH Seizure Corpus (TUSZ) tcp-bipolar EEG.\n",
        "\n",
        "It does:\n",
        "- Recursively walks `train/`, `dev/`, or `eval` under `ROOT_DIR`.\n",
        "- For each EDF:\n",
        "  - Load EEG + its seizure annotations (.csv).\n",
        "  - Bandpass 0.5–40 Hz using a Kaiser FIR, zero-phase (`filtfilt`).\n",
        "  - Downsample to 250 Hz *if* original fs is higher; never upsample.\n",
        "  - Robust z-score per channel (median/IQR).\n",
        "  - Slice into 10 s windows with 5 s hop.\n",
        "  - Label each window seizure(1) or background(0), pooling all seizure subtypes.\n",
        "- Skips recordings that are too short for `filtfilt` padding.\n",
        "- Saves:\n",
        "  - `split_windows.npz` with windows, labels, and metadata.\n",
        "  - `qc_window.png` plotting an informative example window.\n",
        "  - `class_balance.png` showing seizure/background counts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Smart Canonical Montage\n",
        "We do **not** force a giant hard-coded canonical bipolar channel list upfront.\n",
        "Instead we learn a canonical layout from *inside the split*:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The **first usable recording** becomes our **reference layout**.\n",
        "   - We store its channel names/ordering. Call this `ref_ch_names`.\n",
        "2. Every later recording is aligned to that same reference layout:\n",
        "   - For each reference channel name (like `FP1-F7`), we try to find the best-matching channel name in the new recording using a robust normalizer.\n",
        "   - If found, we copy that channel.\n",
        "   - If missing, we fill zeros in that row.\n",
        "3. We compute a **coverage ratio** = fraction of reference channels we could actually fill with real data from this recording.\n",
        "   - If coverage is too low (default <30%), we SKIP that recording to avoid mostly-zero data.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we get:\n",
        "- Consistent `[C, T]` across all recordings (good for training).\n",
        "- Mostly real EEG, not all zeros.\n",
        "- QC plot that reflects the aligned tensors you’ll actually train on.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prediction Labeling\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Positive (y = 1)**: **pre-ictal** windows only — the interval *before onset* where a predictor should alarm.  \n",
        "  Defined per seizure as **[onset − SOP_MIN, onset − SPH_MIN]**.\n",
        "- **Negative (y = 0)**: **interictal** background **plus** a short **early-ictal** portion immediately after onset:  \n",
        "  **[onset, min(onset + EARLY_ICTAL_KEPT_S, offset)]**.\n",
        "- **Ignored** (not used for training): the **prediction horizon** just before onset **(onset − SPH_MIN, onset)**, the **remainder of ictal** after the early-ictal portion, and an optional **post-ictal** buffer **(offset, offset + POSTICTAL_BUFFER_S]** when enabled.\n",
        "- **Artifacts**: windows overlapping artifact intervals are **dropped**; if `KEEP_PREICTAL_EVEN_IF_ARTIFACT = True`, pre-ictal windows are **kept** even when overlapping artifacts (positives are scarce).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Timing variables (all in seconds)\n",
        "- `SOP_MIN` — Seizure Occurrence Period look-back (e.g., 30*60).  \n",
        "- `SPH_MIN` — Seizure Prediction Horizon “no-alarm” band (e.g., 5*60).  \n",
        "- `EARLY_ICTAL_KEPT_S` — early-ictal kept as **negative** (e.g., 10).  \n",
        "- `POSTICTAL_BUFFER_S` — optional ignore after offset (0 disables).  \n",
        "- `KEEP_PREICTAL_EVEN_IF_ARTIFACT` — keep/don’t keep pre-ictal windows that overlap artifacts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Note on normalization (robust z)\n",
        "Pre-ictal windows can be very quiet (IQR≈0). Robust z-score uses a **safe denominator**  \n",
        "`denom = max(IQR, 0.1*STD, 1e-6)` to prevent extreme amplitudes while preserving behavior elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Runtime knobs\n",
        "- `MAX_SUBJECTS`: cap how many subjects to include (fast debug).\n",
        "- `MAX_RECORDINGS`: cap recordings per subject (or overall).\n",
        "- `NUM_TAPS`: FIR length. Shorter => fewer clips skipped for being \"too short\".\n",
        "- `GROUP_MODE`: iterate by `\"subject\"` (recommended) or just all EDFs (`\"recording\"`).\n",
        "- `min_coverage`: skip a recording if < this fraction of reference channels could be mapped."
